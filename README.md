Project: Azure Data Migration and Power BI Reporting

This project outlines the steps to migrate data from an SQL Server database to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and build reports using Power BI.

Steps:                                                                                                                        
Create an Azure SQL Database and upload a CSV file.
Create an Azure storage account.
Create an Azure Data Factory (ADF).                                                                                               
Set up an Azure Databricks integration runtime.                                                                                   
Create an ADF pipeline to load data from SQL Server to ADLS.                                                                      
Use Databricks notebooks to process and transform the data.
Create Power BI reports to visualize the data
